Travel Planner/Guide application based on the theme of durga puja. 
The user will be required to sign up for an account or they can sign in with their Google accounts. Once the user has logged in, they will be provided with a list of pandals. The user can then choose which pandals they want to visit by adding those locations on map. On opening the map the user will be shown a route to the pandals along with food joints and restaurants they can visit near the pandals, and the app will also track the live location of the user and help them navigate.
Users will also have the option to share their planned route with their friends and that will enable their maps to be synced such that both their live locations will be displayed on the map.
